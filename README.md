# The Titan Method üí™üèø ‚Äî Group 16

**HTML5 ‚Ä¢ Modern CSS ‚Ä¢ Bootstrap 5.3 ‚Ä¢ Vanilla JS ‚Ä¢ GitHub Pages**

**Disclaimer**
A previous version included a ‚ÄúLead Capture: Local Storage + JSON Download (no backend)‚Äù flow. We removed it due to security and privacy risk (client-side download of user data) and because the course scope is static HTML/CSS/JS without a backend. This capability will be implemented later in the advanced course.

## Project Purpose

Build a fast, accessible, mobile-first site that converts visitors into trial sign-ups and paid program tiers for **The Titan Method** by Coach Tavion Miles. The site is static and GitHub Pages-ready, with Bootstrap JS modals and client-side validation (no data persistence).

**Core pages**

* Home (`/index.html`)
* Pricing (`/pricing/index.html`)
* Contact (`/contact/index.html`)

---

## What‚Äôs Included

* **Bootstrap 5.3** layout: grid utilities, responsive containers, spacing helpers
* **Theme system**: Light/Dark toggle persisted via `localStorage`
* **Accessible modals**: Bootstrap JS modals with focus-trap and ESC to close
* **Form UX**: Required fields, inline error/success alerts, success modals
* **Keyboard/A11y**: Focus states, ARIA labels, reduced-motion support
* **Scroll helper**: Floating ‚Äúscroll to footer/top‚Äù button with smooth animation
* **Code hygiene**: Scoped selectors; no unused code; single CSS/JS bundle

---

## File Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ pricing/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ contact/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ styles/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ style.css
‚îú‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ script.js
‚îî‚îÄ images/
```

* One global CSS (`styles/style.css`) and one global JS (`scripts/script.js`)
* Bootstrap 5.3 via CDN (CSS + bundle JS)

---

## Running Locally

**A.** Open `index.html` directly in a browser
**B.** Serve statically to mirror Pages paths:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
# visit http://localhost:8080
```

**Deploy (GitHub Pages):** Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Deploy from a branch ‚Üí `main` ‚Üí `/root`

## Features

### 1) Theming

* Toggle in navbar (desktop) and mirrored in mobile
* Persists using `localStorage` key `ttm-theme` (`light` or `dark`)
* Respects `prefers-color-scheme` when no preference is saved

### 2) Forms, Validation, and Success Flow

* All actionable forms use `.js-validate-form.js-demo-form`
* Required inputs: `name`, `email` (+ `subject`, `message` on Contact)
* On success:

  * Green success alert appears
  * If in a modal: the form modal closes and the matching success modal opens
  * On Contact page: opens `#contactSuccess`

### 3) Accessibility

* Labels bound to inputs (`for`/`id`), visible `:focus-visible` outlines
* Modals have `aria-labelledby` and accessible dismiss buttons
* Scroll/reveal animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
* `alt` text on all informative images

### 4) Performance and UX

* Modern CSS (`clamp`, CSS variables)
* Controlled animations; hover/active feedback on pricing cards
* Scroll helper button flips intent (footer vs top) based on position/direction

---

## Development Standards

* Keep README in sync with behavior
* Use Bootstrap grid/utilities for layout; prefer utilities over custom CSS
* Scope JS to intent-specific elements; do not prevent default globally
* Remove unused CSS/JS/HTML before committing
* All new forms must:

  * include `.js-validate-form.js-demo-form`
  * provide `.js-error-msg` and `.js-success-msg` containers
  * set `data-success-modal` when applicable
  * optionally set `data-plan` (e.g., Standard/Premium/VIP/Contact Inquiry)

---

## Testing Checklist (Manual)

**Navigation**

* Mobile navbar toggler opens/closes; focus order is logical; active link highlighted

**Theme**

* Toggle switches light/dark; refresh preserves choice; contrast is legible

**Pricing**

* Standard/Premium/VIP CTAs open the correct modal
* Required fields enforced; valid input shows the correct success modal

**Contact**

* Required fields enforced; success opens `#contactSuccess`

**Keyboard**

* Enter submits forms; ESC dismisses modals; tab order cycles inside modals

**Console**

* No errors; no network calls

# The Titan Method üí™üèø ‚Äî Group 16

**HTML5 ‚Ä¢ Modern CSS ‚Ä¢ Bootstrap 5.3 ‚Ä¢ Vanilla JS ‚Ä¢ GitHub Pages**

**Disclaimer**
An earlier build used a ‚ÄúLead Capture: Local Storage + JSON Download (no backend)‚Äù flow. We removed it due to privacy risk (client-side downloads of user data) and because the course scope is a static site with no backend. This capability will be revisited in the advanced course.

## Project Purpose

Build a fast, accessible, mobile-first site that converts visitors into trial sign-ups and paid tiers for **The Titan Method** by Coach Tavion Miles. Static, GitHub Pages‚Äìready. Bootstrap JS modals and client-side validation only (no data persistence).

**Core pages**

* Home (`/index.html`)
* Pricing (`/pricing/index.html`)
* Contact (`/contact/index.html`)

---

## What‚Äôs Included

* **Bootstrap 5.3** layout utilities
* **Theme system**: Light/Dark toggle (saved in `localStorage`)
* **Accessible modals**: Bootstrap JS, focus-trap, ESC to close
* **Form UX**: Required fields, inline alerts, success modals
* **Keyboard/A11y**: Focus states, ARIA, reduced-motion support
* **Scroll helper**: Floating ‚Äúscroll to footer/top‚Äù button
* **Code hygiene**: Scoped selectors, single CSS/JS bundle

---

## File Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ pricing/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ contact/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ styles/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ style.css
‚îú‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ script.js
‚îî‚îÄ images/
```

* One global CSS and one global JS
* Bootstrap 5.3 via CDN (CSS + bundle JS)

---

## Running Locally

**A.** Open `index.html` directly
**B.** Serve statically:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
# http://localhost:8080
```

**Deploy (GitHub Pages):** Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Deploy from a branch ‚Üí `main` ‚Üí `/root`

---

## Features

### 1) Theming

* Desktop + mobile toggles
* Persists with `localStorage` key `ttm-theme` (`light`/`dark`)
* Respects `prefers-color-scheme` if unset

### 2) Forms & Success Flow

* Forms use `.js-validate-form.js-demo-form`
* Required: `name`, `email` (+ `subject`, `message` on Contact)
* On success: green alert; matching success modal opens (Contact uses `#contactSuccess`)

### 3) Accessibility

* Proper labels/ids, `:focus-visible`, ARIA on modals
* Animations respect reduced-motion
* All informative images have `alt`

### 4) Performance & UX

* Modern CSS (`clamp`, variables)
* Subtle card hover/active feedback
* Scroll helper flips intent based on position

---

## Development Standards

* Keep README in sync with behavior
* Prefer Bootstrap utilities for layout
* Scope JS to intent-specific elements; don‚Äôt block defaults globally
* Remove unused CSS/JS/HTML before committing
* New forms must include:

  * `.js-validate-form.js-demo-form`
  * `.js-error-msg` and `.js-success-msg`
  * `data-success-modal` when applicable
  * optional `data-plan` (Standard/Premium/VIP/Contact)

---
